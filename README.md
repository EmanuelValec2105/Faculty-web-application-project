This is a project I've developed during my college studies for the course "Web Application Development", which was a direct continuation of the "Basics of Web Technologies" course. 

The application consists of:
- Backend: Built with JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript
- Frontend: Developed using Angular framework

The project demonstrates my skills in full-stack web development and implementing modern web technologies.
